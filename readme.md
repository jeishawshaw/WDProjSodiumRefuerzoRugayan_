### Description: 
### This webpage aims to compile all of Taylor Swift's albums and their history so that her fans and even those just discovering her music are able to appreciate not just her music itself, but the background behind it. It will have several features, showing how she made her music, the lyrics to her music, and several visual aids to show her beautiful artistry. As Swifties ourselves, we aim to make this website a comprehensive guide to Taylor's music for the audience.

#### How we will apply JS into our code;

#### In the Albums page, we will add an interactive randomized game that tells you how your Taylor Swift album. There will also be a javascript code that makes Taylor Swift's interests and hobbies formatted as a checklist, where you are able to tick the boxes. We will also add a dropdown so that you'll be able to switch pages without refreshing, allowing it to be smoother.
